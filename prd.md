## Narrative

As Emma finishes reading an inspiring blog post about sustainable living, she feels motivated but doesn't have time to craft a thoughtful comment. She notices five emoji reactions at the bottom of the post and clicks the heart icon to show her appreciation. The button animates with a gentle pulse, and she sees the count increment from 47 to 48, giving her a sense of community with other readers who felt similarly. The entire interaction takes three seconds, allowing her to express genuine engagement before moving on to her next article, while the content creator receives valuable feedback about the emotional impact of their work.
